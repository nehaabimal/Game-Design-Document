# Summary 

The call for repatriation of Indigenous First Nation artefacts (cultural objects) and the human remains of their ancestors has become stronger after the death of Queen Elizabeth II and the end of the second Elizabethan era since museums are a part of the “colonial project” and share a colonial narrative. 

This is a play through of how young journalist Nehaa Bimal's pursuit of a feature story on repatriation and the decolonization of museums led to the discovery of ''the story of the stolen Shebahonaning Anishinaabe cultural artefacts and remains by the University of Michigan's Anthropological Museum.

# Core

[[Design pillars]]
1. Investigation - The game should generate a sense of curiousity, a drive to conduct further in-depth research within and outside the Twine story, and build the player's investigative reporting skills through the quality of their line of questioning and the angles they hope to pursue. 
2. Options: I want to add a level of choices in the types of questioning, research and angles the player decided to pursue or conduct which will enrich the investigative story they are pursuing. 
Options include: 

- You have a chance to ask some questions:  
**''What does it mean to have these cultural objects taken away from your local community? ''**  
OR  
So, what happened to the Shebahonaning Anishinabek cultural objects and where are  
they now?

- You can say yes to see the artefacts OR you can decide to do more research on Emerson Greenman and his excavations in Killarney first.

- You can choose to either ask Proulx more about the shutdown in communications from the University of Michigan, which is an interesting angle to show how unethical archeological pratices in the past are also translating to the present.  
This shows the “the colonial legacy of anthropology and archaeology.”  
OR  
You can decide to focus on rematriation and Indigenizing museums by interviewing other museum curators and directors.

[[Game loops]]

Since the point of an investigative story is to move forward in the research to a conclusive end (the published article), there are not many repetitive elements in my Twine story. I do have a section in "Welcome to Killarney Museum!" where I allow the player to leave and return to the museum after asking Zamiska a personal question (on the emotional impact the loss of the artefacts has on her community). I also allow the player to leave to read up on Dr. Greenman's excavations in Killarney and return to the main investigation into the UMichigan digital archives. 

[[Player motivation and progression]]

Similar to how I progressed in pursuing the story, the player should notice the buildup in the narrative progression from the general concept of repatriation > the stolen Anishinaabe artefacts > the part unethical actions of archeologist Dr. Emerson Greenman > present unethical action of UMichigan > repatriation and the colonial project. 

The player motivation should be in the discovery of previously untold history. This is a historical expose and they, as the reporter, have the access and platform to this story. They should want to know more about the previously unknown

These are the features in your game. They’re game mechanics that apply throughout the whole of the game.

1. I also included a Mural story to my Twine story that adds another layer of research into my piece that was inspired by my Unessay. The Mural is called "Open AI's DALL-E Homogenizes, Stereotypes, and Culturally Appropriates Indigenous Artefacts," and reveals how in constructing my Unessay, I used Open AI's DALL-E to generate graphic art to better illustrate my feature article. It made me question: **How does DALL-E imagine Indigenous cultures? Does it homogenize it, turn it into an awful caricature?** 
2. I include screenshots and hyperlinks to the digital archives of the UMichigan Museum 
3. I have soundcloud links to excerpts from my interviews, as well as the pronounciation of words such as "Shebahonaning" 
4. I have embedded images that tell the story of Killarney Centennial Museum and Dr. Emerson Greenman.

[[Narrative summary]]

The call for repatriation of Indigenous First Nation artefacts (cultural objects) and the human remains of their ancestors has become stronger after the death of Queen Elizabeth II and the end of the second Elizabethan era since museums are a part of the “colonial project” and share a colonial narrative. 

While working at the cabin-style museum, she noticed that there were no interpretive  
texts or cultural objects that illustrated the history of the Anishinaabe people there.

_“In our museum, we don’t have anything that represents our Indigenous heritage in  
Killarney. I have pictures of our Indigenous ancestors but it’s almost as if the missing  
Indigenous artifacts are attempting to erase the Indigenous history of our town,” says  
Zamiska._  

Out of all the objects in the museum’s display, there were only two items that represented  
the Anishinaabe culture: a pair of moccasins and a medicine pouch.

The above images are AI generated pictures of the Indigenous cultural objects Zamiska found - you divert from investigative reporting for your feature to explore how AI culturally appropriates Indigenous objects.  
You have a chance to ask some questions:  
**''What does it mean to have these cultural objects taken away from your local community? ''**  

OR  
**  
So, what happened to the Shebahonaning Anishinabek cultural objects and where are  
they now?**  
She then mentions the name of an infamous archeologist from the 1950s, who is also known as...  
The Bonedigger

This was a photograph of Emmerson Greenman, who for years excavated and removed ancestral remains and ceremonial items on the behalf of the University of Michigan’s Museum of Anthropology.  
Greenman’s archaeological methods were controversial and unethical.   

You give a phone call to Sarah Proulx who is an Anishinaabe archaeologist and doctoral researcher at the University of Toronto. She has a lot of information on Greenman's excavations in Killarney based on her research.

_“The removal of Indigenous sacred items and ancestors from their sacred resting  
places is a clear example of settler, colonial violence and Indigenous erasure,” Proulx says._  
She asks if you want to see some of the stolen artefacts held by the University of Michigan. You have a choice.  
You can say yes OR you can decide to do more research on Emerson Greenman and his excavations in Killarney first.

You ask her to share a little more information on the 60 cultural objects displayed online, which include stone bifaces, Indigenous beads and basketry material, and ceramic sherds.  
You record and listen to what Proulx has to [say.](https://soundcloud.com/nehaa-bimal/sarah-proulx-interview/s-9f8hc5WSb4P?si=6bff65527db743f492f68d2f9d9bbc45&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing)  

You have two angles to pursue as an investigative reporter. It is your choice how this article will be structured.  
You can choose to either ask Proulx more about the shutdown in communications from the University of Michigan, which is an interesting angle to show how unethical archeological pratices in the past are also translating to the present.  

This shows the “the colonial legacy of anthropology and archaeology.”  
OR  
You can decide to focus on rematriation and Indigenizing museums by interviewing other museum curators and directors.  
“To achieve justice for historical injustice in the Indigenous repatriation movement,  
we must imagine otherwise in processes of recovery and return. Rematriation is a decolonial alternative to repatriation, and it is the desired pathway for return."
